# Drift guard for the inline-Rust DSL in this SRPC repository.
#
# Each DSL block carries a `rust_sha256` of the Rust it was generated
# from. If the Rust is edited without regenerating, the block and the
# C++ the compiler actually sees disagree — and NOTHING detects that
# today: no independent regeneration script covers these SRPC carriers. Two
# blocks (client.1, server.1) historically drifted exactly this way.
#
# That matters most during the migration: converting hand-written C++
# into DSL means editing these blocks constantly, and a silent
# divergence means the Rust we later extract is a draft nothing ever
# compiled.
#
# ONE FILE PER INVOCATION, deliberately: `inline-rust --check` stops at
# the first mismatch in a file, so batching under-reports.
#
# Usage: scripts/rrr_dsl_check.sh [path/to/rusty-cpp-transpiler]
