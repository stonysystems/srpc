# Tier 1.4 of docs/testing-plan.md: run the runtime battery under a sanitizer.
#
# The -DSRPC_SANITIZER= configs have always existed but nothing exercised them,
# so leak/race/use-after-free coverage was latent. This wires them into a
# runnable pass. It is a SEPARATE build tree (sanitizers are a whole-config
# switch, per CLAUDE.md) so it never disturbs the normal build/.
#
# It builds and runs ONLY the runtime-battery executables, NOT the Goal-0
# gates. The dual-compile gate is an exact strong-symbol census (1966 symbols)
# and ASan/TSan/UBSan instrumentation injects its own runtime symbols
# (__asan_*, interceptors), which perturbs that census -- so the ABI oracle is
# both meaningless and failing under a sanitizer. Runtime memory/race checking
# is what a sanitizer is for, and that lives in the battery binaries.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_sanitizer_battery.sh [address|thread|undefined]   (default: address)
#
# What it catches per mode:
#   address    fd/memory leaks (LSan) + heap/stack/use-after-free
#   thread     data races across the reactor's poll threads and fibers
#   undefined  UB in the framer/varint/pointer code
#
# Optional-but-recommended pre-commit pass for changes touching the reactor,
# fibers, channels, or the C seam. NOT wired into ctest (a sanitizer build is
# minutes and a whole extra tree); run it deliberately.
