# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## The one thing to understand first

SRPC is a **C++23 named-module RPC library whose every module provider is generated, not hand-written.**
All 37 production modules are canonical **Rust** files living at their historical C++ paths
(`base/`, `misc/`, `reactor/`, `rpc/`), and the pinned `rusty-cpp` transpiler generates
`srpc.<name>.cppm` from them. Two consumers read the *exact same bytes*:

- **rustc/Cargo** — via `src/lib.rs`, a *generated* crate index of
  `#[path = "../rpc/frame_codec.rs"] pub mod frame_codec;` declarations. `src/` holds nothing else.
- **rusty-cpp** — one whole-crate invocation (`--crate Cargo.toml`) emits all 37 `.cppm` providers,
  which are the only *providers* in `libsrpc.a`.

Canonical Rust owns SRPC scheduling, transport policy, serialization, and reliability logic.
`build.rs` and CMake compile the same nine C sources plus the selected architecture's fiber assembly
from `scripts/native-kernel-sources.txt`. Those sources provide individual OS operations, platform
layouts, entropy and clock reads, and context switching. Epoll policy is now in
`reactor/epoll_wrapper.rs`; `reactor/epoll_platform_linux.cc` has been removed. Compatibility headers
import generated modules, while `misc/serializable_support.hpp` supplies bounded C++ trait forwarding.
Do not put SRPC policy in these adapters or patch generated C++ to bypass lowering. Fix canonical Rust
or general compiler support. Read [the runtime ownership and migration notes](docs/canonical-rust-runtime.md).

The dual-compile gate recompiles generated providers, runs its C++ importer against fresh objects and
against the production archive, and compares measured ABI and import inventories. Current expectations
live in `scripts/check_srpc_crate_mode.py`; do not copy symbol totals into documentation. The separate
`srpc_runtime_parity` test compares actual Rust and generated-C++ runtime transcripts. Both checks are
needed: two C++ executions alone cannot validate Cargo behavior.

Consequence that governs almost every edit: **a change to a `.rs` file is simultaneously a Rust change
and a C++ ABI change.** A green `cargo test` does not mean the C++ still builds or keeps its ABI.

## Commands

**Before you commit.** There is no CI — no `.github/`, nothing runs on push. This sequence *is* the
safety net, and the `Verified:` paragraph the commit convention demands is copied out of its output:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo test --locked --workspace --all-targets  # -> passed/failed counts
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release             # -> configure exit code
cmake --build build --parallel 4                                    # -> build exit code (ALL pulls in both gates)
ctest --test-dir build -L srpc --output-on-failure                  # inspect the registered suites too
```

Initialize `third-party/rusty-cpp` and `third-party/googletest` before building. The gitlink and hard
checks in `scripts/extract_srpc_rust.py` and `scripts/check_srpc_crate_mode.py` define the current
transpiler pin; a copied revision in prose is not authoritative:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Rust lane.** Cargo also needs a C compiler and archiver for the shared native kernels:

```sh
cargo test --locked --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --locked --workspace --doc
RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo test --locked --workspace --all-targets   # what the gate actually runs
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings       # a lint here breaks the C++ build

cargo test --test frame_codec_rust                                   # one test file (stem of tests/<stem>.rs)
cargo test --test stat_rust -- --exact some_test_fn_name             # one test function
```

**C++ lane** (needs Clang ≥ 22 with libc++, CMake ≥ 3.30, Ninja, Cargo, Python 3, plus `rg` (ripgrep) and a
populated local Cargo registry — see the two source-gate prerequisites under *Individual gates*):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel 4 --target srpc_goal0_dual_compile
ctest --test-dir build -L srpc --output-on-failure
```

Budget for it: a cold C++ lane is minutes, not seconds — CMake builds the pinned transpiler from
source, builds vendored googletest, and compiles every module BMI under `-march=native`; the battery
suites are `RUN_SERIAL` with `TIMEOUT 600` because they drive real epoll threads and fibers. Don't start
one to answer a Rust-only question; always budget for one before committing a canonical `.rs` change.

```sh
ctest --test-dir build -L runtime_battery --output-on-failure   # configured runtime and parity tests
ctest --test-dir build -R '^test_fiber$' --output-on-failure    # one suite (name = CMake TARGET name)
./build/test_fiber --gtest_filter='FiberTest.SleepUsZero'       # one gtest case
```

Some runtime targets are plain programs, including `test_reactor_minimal` and `test_runtime_parity`.
`--gtest_filter` applies only to gtest targets. Inspect `ctest --test-dir build -N -L srpc` and the explicit
CMake test lists rather than relying on a historical suite count.

**Benchmark.** `rpcbench` is `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` — a benchmark is not a correctness gate, and it is not
registered with ctest (throughput is not pass/fail, and it binds a real TCP port). Build and run it
explicitly; the harness starts a fresh server per trial and prints one `avg_qps` line each:

```sh
cmake --build build --parallel 4 --target rpcbench
scripts/run_rpcbench.sh build/rpcbench before-my-change   # 4 modes x 3 trials
```

Modes are `fast|fiber|defer|async|fast_vec` and exercise different dispatch paths (inline / stackful
fiber / deferred reply / stackless task / vector payload), so a change can move one and not the others.
`fast_vec` needs `-v` and is omitted by default as a different workload. Read the *spread* across trials,
not the best number: on a shared machine an effect smaller than the trial-to-trial range is not an effect.
Override with `RPCBENCH_N` (seconds), `RPCBENCH_B` (packet bytes), `RPCBENCH_TRIALS`, `RPCBENCH_MODES`.

`bench/` is the *other* benchmark, and it answers a different question: nanosecond-resolution timing of
the hot leaf codecs (`frame_codec_write_header`, `sparseint_dump64`/`load64` per length class). rpcbench
cannot see effects at that scale — a sub-ns leaf change is ~0.05% of a request, far under its trial
spread — so neither substitutes for the other. Like `verify/`, `bench/` is **workspace-excluded**, so
`cargo test --workspace --all-targets` never compiles it and it adds nothing to the source gate:

```sh
scripts/run_microbench.sh                          # current tree
scripts/run_microbench.sh --compare <refA> <refB>  # A/B, alternating, same sitting
```

The compare mode is the one that answers questions: it builds each ref in a detached worktree, copies
*today's* `bench/` into both so the harness is held constant, and interleaves the runs. Absolute ns/op is
machine- and thermal-dependent; only the back-to-back delta means anything. A cautionary tale lives in
`docs/verification.md`: a "+12% regression" sat in that file for a while on the strength of an
uncommitted harness, and vanished the moment a committed one re-took it.

**Individual gates.** The source gate checks canonical inventory, compiler contracts, native kernel
ownership, canonical Rust bodies, Cargo independence, negative controls, Rust tests, and clippy. The extraction check needs the
built transpiler; build it with `cmake --build build --target build_rusty_cpp_transpiler`. The DSL check no
longer does — it still accepts a transpiler path for CMake compatibility, but never runs it.

```sh
python3 scripts/tests/test_goal0_standalone.py
python3 scripts/tests/test_goal0_contracts.py
python3 scripts/rust_source_audit.py
python3 scripts/check_rust_independence.py
python3 scripts/check_native_kernels.py
python3 scripts/tests/test_rust_source_audit.py
python3 scripts/tests/test_native_kernels.py
python3 scripts/tests/test_rust_independence.py
python3 scripts/tests/test_runtime_parity.py
python3 scripts/extract_srpc_rust.py --check
bash scripts/srpc_dsl_check.sh
```

Two host prerequisites are easy to miss because nothing in the tree vendors them, and both fail the *source
gate*, not just the standalone script:

- `scripts/srpc_dsl_check.sh` shells out to `rg` (ripgrep) under `set -euo pipefail`. Without `rg` on
  `PATH` the command substitution exits 127, the script reports `canonical source scan failed` and
  propagates that status — it fails closed rather than reporting zero carriers.
- `scripts/rust_source_audit.py` builds its `syn` AST scanner with
  `cargo build --quiet --locked --offline --manifest-path scripts/rust_source_audit/Cargo.toml` and
  `check=True`. `--offline` means the crates in `scripts/rust_source_audit/Cargo.lock` (`syn`, `quote`,
  `proc-macro2`, `serde_json` and their transitive deps) must already be in the local Cargo registry; on a
  cold machine, warm it once with network access before running the gate offline.

The canonical Rust AST audit rejects missing implementations and pins reviewed constant functions in
`scripts/canonical-constant-functions.json`. It scans private and nested production bodies too.
`scripts/check_rust_independence.py` copies only Cargo sources, tests and the C/assembly kernel into a
fresh tree, then runs Rust tests and doctests with no C++ runtime or compiler on its tool path. Production
Cargo dependencies and extra workspace packages are rejected. Native source/header changes require
review against `scripts/native-kernels.json`. These inventories have no automatic approval command.
Check test output for skips: missing compiler dependencies can skip contract tests and cannot establish
acceptance.

**Verus** (separate lane, not wired into CMake or ctest):

```sh
VERUS_HOME=/path/to/verus-dist scripts/verify_srpc.sh
```

**Sanitizers** are a whole-configuration switch, so use a separate build dir:
`cmake -S . -B build-asan -G Ninja -DSRPC_SANITIZER=address` (`none|address|thread|undefined`).

There are two gate targets, both in `ALL`: `srpc_goal0_source_gate` (source side — DSL check,
extraction check, ownership audits, Python negative controls, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`) and
`srpc_goal0_dual_compile` (archive side — the `nm`/ABI oracle in `check_srpc_crate_mode.py`). The `srpc`
library target depends on the source gate, so *any* C++ build runs the whole Rust suite first, and a new
clippy warning breaks the C++ build. A green source gate says nothing about ABI.

## Invariants that will bite you

**`#[cfg_attr(any(), …)]` is the emitter's directive language, and rustc never sees it.** `any()` is
always false, so these 29 attributes are invisible to `cargo build`, `cargo test` and clippy while being
the only way to state a C++ contract Rust cannot: `thread_local` (0 — the reactor's nine migrated to real `thread_local!`, which the transpiler lowers
to `inline thread_local rusty::LocalKey<T>`; the marker spelling is retired),
`cpp_namespace(::janus)` (8 — the Quorum surface, which must live in *global* `::janus`; `srpc::janus::QuorumEvent`
mangles differently and is not a substitute), `cpp_noexcept` (4), `cpp_no_fieldwise_ctor` (3),
`cpp_no_auto_traits` (3), `cpp_abi` (3), `cpp_trait_member_dispatch` (3), `cpp_default_argument` (2),
`cpp_marker_trait` (2), `cpp_abi_alias` (1). Three further `cfg_attr(any(), …)` spellings live inside
`//` comments (`base/misc.rs`, `reactor/reactor.rs` twice) and are not attributes — do not count them.
Deleting or mistyping one is silent in the Rust lane and
changes the emitted module. The mirror form `#[cfg_attr(not(any()), derive(...))]` (19 sites) is the
opposite — derives rustc *does* apply but the emitter must not see, so plain `#[derive(...)]` is not the
same edit and emits C++ operators that were deliberately withheld. (`IdempotencyKey`'s hand-written
`impl PartialEq` is the only source of the `operator==` symbol the ABI table pins, precisely because its
derive is hidden behind `not(any())`.)

**`#[allow(clippy::…)]` in canonical sources are measured emitter pins, not style waivers.**
`rpc/client.rs` opens with a block recording exactly what each costs — taking clippy's suggestion renames
`DisconnectBehavior_QUEUE()`, retypes `clientpool_select`, changes a method signature, or deletes
`FutureAttr::default_()`. And of the 34 `explicit_auto_deref` allow attributes across the canonical dirs,
23 are in `rpc/client.rs` alone; the per-site comments there record which ones change emitted C++ and how.
That family's suggestions are `MachineApplicable`, so `clippy --fix` applies them without ever seeing the
consequence.
**Never run `clippy --fix` over `base/ misc/ rpc/ reactor/`.** (The module-level `#![allow(static_mut_refs)]` pin in
`reactor/reactor.rs` is retired: the statics it covered migrated to `thread_local!`.)

**`src/lib.rs` is generated — never hand-edit it.** It carries a sha256 of `rust-modules.toml` in its
header, so touching the manifest without `extract_srpc_rust.py --write` fails the gate. Never add any
other file, or any symlink, under `src/`: the census in `extract_srpc_rust.py` rejects symlinks and
orphan `.rs` files, and `test_goal0_standalone.py` asserts `src/` contains exactly `lib.rs`.

**Adding a canonical module is a seven-place edit**, and missing one is a hard error:
1. a `[[module]]` row in `rust-modules.toml` — **append at the end**. The list is historical *promotion*
   order, not a dependency order (`srpc.utils` precedes `srpc.logging`, which it imports); the gate
   topologically re-sorts at build time. What *is* enforced is that CMake's inventories match this file's
   order element-for-element, so an alphabetical insertion fails;
2. `python3 scripts/extract_srpc_rust.py --write` to regenerate `src/lib.rs`;
3. `SRPC_GOAL0_CANONICAL_MODULES`, `set(SRPC_GOAL0_SOURCE_<name> …)` and `SRPC_GOAL0_RETIRED_CARRIER_SRC`
   in `CMakeLists.txt`;
4. the hard-coded provider total `37` in `CMakeLists.txt` (`math(EXPR _SRPC_EXPECTED_INLINE_COUNT "37 - …")`
   and the two `EQUAL 37` checks) — otherwise configure aborts with
   *"Goal-0 production must contain all 37 retained module providers"*;
5. the hard-coded `37` in `scripts/tests/test_goal0_contracts.py` (`ExtractionContractTests`) — this one
   fires in the transpiler-free standalone lane, so it is the first failure you will hit;
6. the ratchet tables in `scripts/check_srpc_crate_mode.py` (`ABI_SPECS`, `EXPECTED_IMPORTS`,
   `EXPECTED_GENERATED_MODULE_SHA256`, `IMPORTER_USE_MARKERS`) **and** the ~3,650-line C++ importer
   program embedded as a Python string in that same file (`importer_source()`) — `require_importer_coverage`
   demands each module be imported there exactly once *and* actually used;
7. rows in `module-preambles.toml` / `cpp-module-index.toml` / `rust-type-map.toml` if the module needs
   C++ includes, foreign symbols, or exact legacy type spellings.

**Ordinary edits trip ABI checks too.** The current `ABI_SPECS`, provider totals, platform ownership,
and ordered `EXPECTED_IMPORTS` live in `scripts/check_srpc_crate_mode.py`. An intended public change
requires fresh generated objects and measured symbol/layout evidence before changing those expectations.
Record why the interface changed. Do not read a new count from a success message that merely echoes an
expected constant.

New standard containers or canonical module dependencies can change the generated import list. Direct
`crate::reactor` types and calls must retain their canonical dependency, using the supported
`use crate::reactor as _;` anchor where needed. Rust aliases must not be redirected to omitted facade
implementations to make an import error disappear. The generated crate must report zero hand-attention
slots; `TODO`/`UNSUPPORTED`/`skipped` generated output is rejected. Generated byte digests are advisory,
unlike ABI and ownership checks.

**Canonical `.rs` files are byte-policed:** UTF-8, LF only (CRLF is rejected, not normalized), a trailing
newline, no NUL. They may only live under `base/`, `misc/`, `rpc/`, `reactor/`, and the basename must equal
the module name.

**`-march=native` is an ABI requirement, not an optimization.** Clang refuses to load a BMI whose
target-feature set differs from the importer's, so removing it produces ~133 bogus errors. Build trees are
therefore not portable across CPUs.

**Verus specs use `#[cfg(verus)]`, never `verus_only`.** The pinned transpiler special-cases that exact
ident; renaming it breaks the whole-crate transpile. `verify/.cargo/config.toml` forces `--cfg verus`
locally because `cargo verus` itself only sets `verus_only`.

**A module-scope `const` IS ABI surface.** P1815 attaches it to the module, and it lands in the object
as a strong `R` symbol regardless of use — the `SERVER_ERR_*` block, `kAsyncSlotCount` and the sink
capacity seeds are all pinned rows. So adding one is an ordinary ratchet edit, not a trick to dodge:
an `ABI_SPECS` row, the `EXPECTED_TOTAL_PROVIDER_SYMBOLS` bump with its delta comment, the module's
incumbent-oracle reviewed-additions row where one exists (`srpc.client` and `srpc.reactor` have them),
and `test_goal0_contracts.py`'s hard-coded totals. Two further wires, both measured: the exported name
must be **unique across all 37 modules** — two modules exporting one name into `namespace srpc` is an
import-time ambiguity for any TU importing both (it broke the dual-compile importer and the rpcbench
link alike) — and the flat-import contract rejects importing a cross-module root-level const outright,
which is why such constants are spelled per-module.

**Errno values are spelled as raw numerics** (`SERVER_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT = 22`, the `TCP_ERR_*` block)
so generated modules stay valid alongside `errno.h`. Syscall numbers and build flags are the *opposite*:
`SYS_gettid` and `REUSE_FIBER` must never be Rust constants — their values are arch- and
build-dependent, so they go behind the plain-C seam (`srpc_reactor_gettid`, `srpc_reactor_reusing_fiber`).

**Bumping the transpiler pin means four edits**: the gitlink, plus the literal in
`scripts/extract_srpc_rust.py`, `scripts/check_srpc_crate_mode.py`, and `scripts/tests/test_goal0_standalone.py`.

## Testing

**Rust lane.** Cargo discovers `tests/*_rust.rs`, whose integration tests import the actual `srpc`
library, never a `#[path]` copy or a test-local `mod` implementation. `build.rs` links the shared native kernels. Runtime tests must not replace fiber switches,
clocks, sockets, or worker scheduling with inert symbols. Isolated fault injection must test a stated
native contract and be paired with real-kernel coverage.

The canonical worker drives both stackful handlers and stackless tasks under Cargo. Tests cover real
TCP requests, a suspended handler sharing its service with a fast request, timer ordering, foreign wake
dispatch on the owner thread, retained wake lifetime, fiber receive/close, and concurrent connection
teardown. Serialization tests recover actual payloads through canonical archives, holders and registries.
See [the runtime notes](docs/canonical-rust-runtime.md) for named tests and API migration details.

The Rust suite also includes property tests for wire round trips, malformed input, and stream chunking.
Run documentation tests separately, since `--all-targets` does not run compile-fail documentation checks.
Internal synchronization layouts may differ between languages; C++ ABI measurements belong in the
C++ gate, not in invented Rust-size equivalents. Keep tests for real public wire/ABI contracts.

**C++ lane.** CMake explicitly lists test sources. Adding a `.cc` file does not register or build it.
Use `ctest --test-dir build -N -L srpc` to inspect the configured inventory, then run
`ctest --test-dir build -L srpc --output-on-failure`. Missing googletest or omitted runtime targets
must not be mistaken for a passing complete battery. Vendored rusty-cpp tests have a separate inventory.
Historical test files may still depend on the upstream Mako layout. Their presence in `tests/` does not
prove they compile or run; check the actual CMake target and include paths.

`srpc_runtime_parity` executes `tests/runtime_parity_rust.rs` and `tests/runtime_parity_test.cc`, rejects
missing or malformed transcripts, checks independent expected results, and compares the two languages.
The C++ dual-compile importer and ABI check remain separate. Run
`scripts/run_sanitizer_battery.sh [address|thread|undefined]` in separate configurations for runtime,
channel, ownership, and native-boundary changes. A successful ordinary build does not establish
sanitizer acceptance.

**Verus lane.** `verify/` is a workspace-excluded crate that `#[path]`-links the real sources and runs
`cargo verus verify` against them; five modules carry specs today — `base/basetypes.rs`, `misc/stat.rs`,
`rpc/errors.rs`, `rpc/frame_codec.rs` and `rpc/internal_protocol.rs`, each with a matching `#[path]` line in
`verify/src/main.rs`. A
canonical module may carry any contract that proves with **no in-body proof steps** — the transpiler's
preflight rejects opaque macros, so no in-body `proof!`. (`internal_protocol.rs` uses purely definitional
`ensures r == <wire-bit expression>`; `stat.rs` uses `requires old(self)…` / `ensures final(self)…` and still
stays in the module.) Only theorems needing `by (bit_vector)` move to `verify/src/*_proofs.rs`, which is
never transpiled. Adding a spec is a two-file edit: annotate the module, then add a `#[path]` line to
`verify/src/main.rs` — hand-maintained, nothing cross-checks it. Per `docs/verification.md`, **always run a
negative control**: perturb the body, confirm it goes red, revert. A green that never went red proves nothing.

## Runtime architecture

Layering is `base/` → `misc/` → `reactor/` → `rpc/`, within one flat `srpc` crate.
`reactor/reactor.rs` imports the pollable contract from `rpc/pollable_proxy.rs`. Its callers use canonical
`crate::reactor` types and functions. Cargo uses the Rust standard library and the reviewed C/assembly
kernel; no facade package or generated C++ runtime enters that dependency graph. C-layout declarations,
scheduling and wake admission remain canonical Rust. See [canonical-rust-runtime.md](docs/canonical-rust-runtime.md) for ownership boundaries.

**Request path.** Generated proxy → `Client::request` → `ClientConnection::request` →
`clientconn_request_via_channel` (circuit-breaker gate → stale-request expiry → offline-queue check →
`Future::create(xid)` into `pending_fu_` → serialize `v64 xid | i32 rpc_id | args`) →
`ChannelConnectionProxy::send_frame` → **the TCP backend adds the 4-byte header** → poll thread → the
server-side `TcpConnection`'s `FrameStreamReader` re-frames and fires `on_frame` (this lives in
`rpc/tcp_channel.rs`, *not* `server.rs`) → `sconn_decode_request_and_dispatch` → fast RPCs dispatch inline on
the poll thread, everything else spawns a stackful fiber → `sconn_reply` writes
`v64 xid | v32 error | v64 server_instance_id | payload` → client `clientconn_decode_response_and_notify`
resolves the async slot (`xid % 16384`) first, then the `pending_fu_` map. A reply matching neither is
silently dropped — the normal outcome after a timeout, and it leaves no trace.

**Wire format** (`rpc/internal_protocol.rs`, `rpc/frame_codec.rs`): 4-byte **native-endian** header — bit 31
is the extended-header flag, bits 0-30 the payload size. `kMaxFramePayloadSize` (64 MiB) is a
*stream-integrity* bound, not a resource policy: without it a desynced stream returns `NeedMoreBytes`
forever and the connection wedges silently. It must stay ≤ `i32::MAX - 4`. Note the TCP *send* path
open-codes the header rather than calling `frame_codec_write_header`, so a header-layout change means
editing both places.

**Channels** (`rpc/channel.rs`): two implementations — TCP (`rpc/tcp_channel.rs`) and in-memory
(`rpc/inmemory_channel.rs`, which is frameless and synchronous, so it can never reproduce a framing bug).
`FiberChannel` is *not* an implementation; it adapts callback delivery into a fiber-blocking `recv_frame()`.
TCP is auto-installed by `Client::connect` / `Server::start`; to use in-memory you must
`set_channel_factory` *before* connect/start.

**Concurrency is both stackful and stackless.** Fibers are mmap'd stacks (1 MiB default + guard page)
switched by `reactor/fiber_context_{x86_64,aarch64}.S`; the field order of `srpc_fiber_ctx` in
`reactor/srpc_fiber.h` *is* the ABI contract with that assembly. The `Reactor` uses real thread-local
storage in both Rust and generated C++, and also drives stackless
`rusty::Task` pollers. Cross-thread wake ingress is synchronized; fiber events remain owner-thread state.

**Reliability layers** (circuit breaker, heartbeat, reconnect policy, connection state machine, request
queue, metrics) are embedded by value in `ClientConnection`. Only four configs are staged on `Client` and
applied at `connect` (keepalive, heartbeat, circuit breaker, reconnect policy). The request queue is the
trap: its `BufferingConfig` is *not* staged — `Client::set_buffering_config` silently no-ops until a
connection exists, so it must be called *after* `connect`. `LoadBalancer` is used only by `ClientPool`.

## Native and C++ adapters

`srpc.hpp` and compatibility headers import generated modules. Their include/import ordering matters
for libc++ module declarations; keep textual includes before named-module imports.
`misc/serializable_support.hpp` supplies C++ ADL and individual STL operations. The exported
`misc/serializable_adapters.hpp` epilogue supplies erased trait dispatch. Canonical Rust owns byte
handling, collection loops, errors and concrete holders. Compiler attributes use inert `cfg_attr`
markers and require no Cargo package or C++ marker header.
Global C declarations enter generated modules through `module-preambles.toml`, including
`reactor/srpc_epoll.h` and `reactor/srpc_fiber.h`.

There is no remaining production inline-Rust DSL carrier. `scripts/srpc_dsl_check.sh` enforces that
absence, and `scripts/check_native_kernels.py` rejects handwritten C++ implementation files under the
canonical directories. Native sources and headers are reviewed and pinned. Adding an adapter requires
an explicit contract and proof that SRPC policy still has a canonical Rust owner.

## Code generation (`pylib/`)

`.rpc` IDL → C++ header and Python stub, via a yapps-2 parser. Not wired into CMake at all; outputs are
checked in, and `tests/benchmark_service.rpc` is the only input. Three traps:

**`pylib/simplerpcgen/rpcgen.py` is the live generator and has been hand-edited since generation.**
`rpcgen.g` is a stale grammar whose epilogue lacks `load_existing_rpc_codes`, the `existing_codes` argument,
and the `archive` flag. **Never regenerate `rpcgen.py` from `rpcgen.g`** — it would drop the id
stabilization below. (There is no yapps compiler vendored anyway; `pylib/yapps/` is runtime-only.)

**RPC method ids are `random.randint(...)`, stabilized only by scraping them back out of the previously
generated `.h`.** Never delete the generated header before regenerating, or every id changes and wire
compatibility silently breaks. Renaming a service function reassigns its id for the same reason.

**`bin/rpcgen` does not exist here.** Drive the generator through `simplerpcgen` with `pylib/` on
`sys.path`; `tests/rpcgen_typed_structs_test.py --repo .` uses that entry point. Generated service handlers
and dispatch wrappers are const-callable; user overrides must match and synchronize mutable state.
`rpcgen_compile_test.py` still names upstream `src/deptran/*.rpc` paths absent from this checkout.

## Conventions

**Commits:** `<scope>: <lowercase imperative>` where scope is the canonical module basename
(`frame_codec:`, `stat:`, `client:`) or an area (`build:`, `docs:`, `tests:`, `verify:`, `gate:`, `goal0:`).
`srpc:` for tree-wide changes. The legacy `rrr:` prefix is retired — do not reuse it. Because there is no CI,
bodies carry the audit trail: a narrative of the defect and a `Verified:` paragraph with *measured* numbers
(test counts, configure/build exit codes, the ABI symbol count). A minority of test-touching commits (34 of
the 354 that touch `tests/`) also add a `Tests:` paragraph naming the new test — `0d6274b` and `aeca82a` are
the recent examples, while `0e51bce` changed `tests/stat_rust.rs` without one. Transpiler pin bumps get their own commit:
`build: bump rusty-cpp <old> -> <new>`.

**Style:** `//` line comments only, with long "why this constant exists" blocks as the house norm. Most
constants are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (`TCP_ERR_AGAIN`, `SERVER_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT`); 14 keep C++-style
`k`-prefixed camelCase — mostly framing and reactor (`kFrameHeaderSize`, `kResponseSizeMask`,
`kDefaultStackBytes`) but also `kAsyncSlotCount` in `client.rs`, `kDefaultDrainTimeoutMs` in `server.rs` and
`kRequestQueue*Error` in `request_queue.rs`. Match the surrounding file. `unsafe_code` is denied crate-wide;
eight files carry a file-scope `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` (`reactor/{reactor,fiber}.rs`,
`rpc/{client,server,tcp_channel,inmemory_channel,fiber_channel}.rs`, `misc/any_message.rs`) and elsewhere
`unsafe` gets a narrow per-item `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` — never relax the crate-level deny. There is no
rustfmt/clippy/clang-format config.

**`.apas` in the repo root is an agent-harness session file, untracked and ignored via `.gitignore`
(`/.apas`).** Never commit it: `git add -A` skips it only because of that ignore rule, so do not `git add -f`
it or loosen the rule.

## Historical documents

[translation-parity-audit.md](docs/translation-parity-audit.md) records the pre-repair baseline and
its original findings. Its source line numbers, counts, and removed facade paths refer to the audited
revision. [canonical-rust-runtime.md](docs/canonical-rust-runtime.md) describes the current implementation
and migration contracts, with final whole-crate and sanitizer acceptance tracked separately.

`RUST_CANARY.md` and `reactor/CANONICAL_CHECKPOINT.md` contain older inventories and compiler blockers.
`docs/srpc-book.md` also has pre-migration mutable service/channel and reply-guard examples. Check those
against the canonical source and current migration notes before copying them. Use `git show` at the
recorded baseline when investigating a historical claim.

When prose and code disagree, `CMakeLists.txt`, `rust-modules.toml`, and the current gates in `scripts/`
define the build contracts. Record measured results from the revision actually being accepted.
