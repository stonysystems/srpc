// Why these two functions exist: they are the executable proof that the

// `async fn` as a C++ coroutine returning `rusty::Task<T>` (`return` and the
// trailing expression become `co_return`, `.await` becomes `co_await`), and
// under rustc the same source is an ordinary Rust future.  `async_double`
// is the leaf; `async_double_twice` awaits it twice, pinning sequential
// `co_await` chaining.  Both are driven by tests in both lanes and by the
// out-of-repo bench's `-m async` handler, which spawns them through the same
// `reactor_spawn_stackless_task_with_result` path the generated C++ async
// wrappers use.  Keep them side-effect-free: their observable value is the
// lowering itself.
// Why this pair exists: the executable pilot for the `thread_local!`
// lowering, on the same pattern as the async pair below.  The transpiler
// emits the declaration as `thread_local rusty::LocalKey<T>` (per-thread
// storage, lazily initialized per thread, destroyed at thread exit -- the
// std::thread::LocalKey semantics) and the `.with(closure)` access sites
// lower through the ordinary method-call path.  Under rustc this is the
// real std macro.  Both lanes' batteries assert two threads see independent
// counters -- the exact property the reactor's nine statics need before
// they can migrate off `#[cfg_attr(any(), thread_local)]` + `static mut`.
